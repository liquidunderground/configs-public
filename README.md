Liquid Underground Config Repository
====================================

This repository serves as a place to exchange useful configuration material
and tips to quickly and easily get started using the software around the
Liquid Underground network. Before you start contributing however, see our `QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS` below.

Quality Assurance Requirements
------------------------------

1. **Don't disclose any personal information:** You are putting yourself at
   risk here, not others. If you really need to include personal info
   such as file paths, replace them with generic dummies, like `/file/to/profile.toml`.
2. **Include useful information:** Make it easy for people to get started
   using your content and to know what they're getting into. It's better to
   be explicit than leave crucial info out and confuse people here.
3. **Know where your content is most appropriate:** Not everyone using this
   repository is using all the same tools. For example, if you created a
   launch script using LiquidLauncher, place it in `srb2/launchscripts`
   rather than `liquidlauncher/scripts`, as LiquidLauncher isn't required
   to run these scripts.
4. **Remember you are not alone:** Even if you found (or made) the most
   amazing software in the world and are looking to first share your
   configs here, leave some space for others to contribute as well.  
   Also, others may submit patches to your content which we'll have to evaluate as well.
